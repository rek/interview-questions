## 1. Interview questions:

### Why did you apply?

### What have you been doing to keep learning? (sites/methods etc)

### What OS do you use?

### Where do you live?

### What is your current salary? (normally they say 20%+ higher)

### Are you married/have kids?

### What transport do you have?

### Have you got any questions?

## 2. Less awesome questions if you run out of stuff to say:

### What are your strengths?

### Have you even worked with a remote team?


NOTES:
 Look at how much they've learned and in what time frame they learned it.
 If they have been developing for 7 years and they're still at the junior level,
 maybe that's not the one to hire.

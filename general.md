## Interview questions:

### How did you hear about us?

### Why did you apply?

### What are your strengths?

### Have you even worked with a remote team?

### What have you been doing to keep learning? (sites/methods etc)

### Have you got any questions?


NOTES:
 Look at how much they've learned and in what time frame they learned it.
 If they have been developing for 7 years and they're still at the junior level,
 maybe that's not the one to hire.
